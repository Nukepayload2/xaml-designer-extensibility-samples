# XAML Designer Extensibility Samples
Starting in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 as a public preview, the XAML designer supports two different architectures: the designer isolation architecture and the
most recent surface isolation architecture. [This article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/xaml-designer-extensibility-migration?view=vs-2019)
 explains the changes in detail. This GitHub repository contains the code samples that demonstrate how to use XAML designer extensibility.
